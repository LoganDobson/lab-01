        <h2>What schools have I attended?</h2>
        <p>
            Since i grew up in Creemore I attended the local Elementary school NCPS which stands for Nottawasaga Creemore 
            Public School. It is a very Small school of about 100-200 students. At the end of grade 5 my family moved to
            Brampton, The School I attended was called Williams Parkway Sr. Public School. It was a huge difference as it
            had about 1400 students and went from grade 6-8. For High School my family migrated north again and moved to Collingwood,
            I attended Collingwood Collegiate Institute for my high school which I graduated in 2020.

        <h2>What achievments have I made?</h2>
        <p>
            I have made several achievments in my life, one being that I graduated high school as an ontario scholar. 
            I was also appointed assistant manager (by my manager) at my previous job. I am also quite proud of myself 
            for beating Elden Ring having never played a souls game beforehand. My most recent achievement is getting accepted 
            into Computer Programming at Georgian College. I am hoping to achieve much more during my years attending this school
            and afterwards once I graduate.

        <h2>What are my goals and ambitions?</h2>
        <p>
            After I finish my undergrad, I want to pursue a post-graduate certificate in CyberSecurity, thus allowing me to get a 
            well-paying job that will support me in the future. Another goal of mine is to eventually open my own business, 
            however, I am unsure of what kind. My current goal is to work on my physical health; I want to excersice 
            more and get into shape.
