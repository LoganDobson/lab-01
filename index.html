        <h2>What schools have I attended?</h2>
        <p>
            Since i grew up in Creemore I attended the local Elementary school NCPS which stands for Nottawasaga Creemore 
            Public School. It is a very Small school of about 100-200 students. At the end of grade 5 my family moved to
            Brampton, The School I attended was called Williams Parkway Sr. Public School. It was a huge difference as it
            had about 1400 students and went from grade 6-8. For High School my family migrated north again and moved to Collingwood,
            I attended Collingwood Collegiate Institute for my high school which I graduated in 2020.

            I have made several achievments in my life, one being that I graduated high school as an ontario scholar. 
            I was also appointed assistant manager (by my manager) at my previous job. I am also quite proud of myself 
            for beating Elden Ring having never played a souls game beforehand
